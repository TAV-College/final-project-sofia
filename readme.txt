I created a backend project focused on the adoption of cats and dogs.
Users can view pets that are available for adoption.
They can browse cats or dogs separately if they are interested in a specific species.
Users can consult the details of the pet they are interested in.
Staff members can add pets for adoption.
Users can sign up and log in to be contacted by the staff members.
